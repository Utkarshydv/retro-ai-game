# 🎮 RetroAI: Prototype 

RetroAI is a sleek, dark-themed emulator launcher and game dashboard built with Streamlit. It supports PlayStation Portable (PSP) and Nintendo 3DS games, allowing you to view game metadata (title, release date, rating, and cover art) and launch your ROMs directly using emulators like PPSSPP and Citra.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Game metadata fetcher (via RAWG API or manual fallback)
- 🎮 Emulator launch integration (PPSSPP for PSP, Citra for 3DS)
- 📂 Supports multiple games side-by-side
- 💻 Dark-themed UI with bold styling
- 🚀 Local ROM detection and smart name matching

## 🕹️ Emulators Required

- [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/) (for PSP ROMs)
- [Citra](https://citra-emu.org/) (for 3DS ROMs)

Make sure both are installed and accessible via system path.
